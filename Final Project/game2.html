    <!-- The intended audience is targeted towards people who enjoy more technical games. Nothing flashy and simple things that me and others like me would find interesting. -->
    <!-- I wanted to keep the layout of my page simple which was very messy at first, but I added some hover effects that make it more pleasing. -->
    <!-- Choosing colors took me a while because I wanted just a white background at first. I feel that the tan background fits better and allows me to use the colors I intended without making the most hideous thing imaginable. It also keeps the very simple and basic feel that I was going for. -->
