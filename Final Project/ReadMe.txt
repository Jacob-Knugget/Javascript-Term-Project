Tabletop Game Instructions:
-This game is a simple drag & drop that is designed to be used in tangine with a Dungeons & Dragons ruleset
-Currently you simply use the tokens on the board

Later Release Potential:
-I plan to eventually have tokens duplicate so there is no limit to the number of a single token that you use and frees up space in the token selector section that I have.
-I also plan to allow the background to be changed with the click of a button. (such as a forest)



Garen vs Darius Instructions:
-This game allows you to move Garen and Darius around the map while making them shout at eachother (revolutionary I know).

Later Release Potential:
-This game is not done yet and will have changes.
-I plan on having Darius controlled by an AI and your goal is to chase him around and score points when you come in contact with him.
